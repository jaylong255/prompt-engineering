Experimenting with prompt engineering. 

codename `lsb`, which is short for lightsaber since i see the ability for humans to effectively harness 
narrow ai in an advanced way by coding as akin to a jedi building a lightsaber. while others can use
a jedi's saber, it was clearly built by and for a specific force-sensitive person. plus it sounds trippy.

Using [this](https://github.com/dair-ai/Prompt-Engineering-Guide/blob/main/guides/prompts-applications.md) as a guide.
